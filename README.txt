Taylens is a simple python implementation of nearest-neighbor Taylor
interpolation lensing. It is provided in the taylens module, which
defines the core functionality, and a driver script "taysim.py",
which provides a convenient command-line interface.

Taylens depends on python2, scipy and healpy.

Here are some simple usage examples:

  1. python taysim.py ps.txt out

     Generates a random temperature-only realization of the unlensed CMB
     and lensing field at nside 512 from the power spectrum ps.txt, which must be
     in the same format as CAMB's scalar spectrum, i.e. [l,tt,ee,te,phi,...].
     The CMB is then lensed with the lensing field at interpolation
     order 3, and the power spectrum of the result is written to
     out/spec000_3.txt. The output spectrum has the format [tt].

  2. python taysim.py -n 10 -g -O 2 -nside 2048 -p -v ps.txt out

     Generates 10 simulations, each at nside 2048 with interpolation
     order 2, with full polarization (-p), while printing verbose
     status information (-v). The -g switch turns on proper parallel
     transport support, which is not really necessary. The outputs
     are written to out/spec000_2.txt .. out/spec009_2.txt, and have the format
     [tt,ee,bb,te,eb,tb].

  3. python taysim.py -o uls ps.txt out

     As example 1, but outputs the unlensed CMB simulation
     as out/ucmb000_3.fits (u), the lensed CMB as out/lcmb000_3.fits (l),
     and the lensed spectrum as out/spec000_3.txt (s).

  4. mpirun -npernode 1 python taysim.py -n 256 -p -nside 1024 -v

     Generates 256 polarized realizations using MPI, with
     1 task per node (each task uses Healpy's OpenMP parallelization,
     so the whole node will be used), while being verbose.

  5. OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun python taysim.py -n 256 -p

     As #4, but at nside 512, and running one task per core,
     with no OpenMP.
